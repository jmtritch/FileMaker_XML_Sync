  Purpose: Converts ASCII text to binary text representation of
                 0's and 1's 
  Author: J. Michael Tritchler
  Notes: This function was developed as part of importing and
              exporting the contents of an ASCII text file stored
              in a container field
  Parameters:
         text - ASCII text to be converted to binary text
  Data Type Returned:
         text
  Variables:
         $$intCode - Integer representation of the ASCII character
         $$binary - Binary text representation of the ASCII text
         ~return - Returns the binary text representation of ASCII text
  Depends On:
         IntToByte( number )
